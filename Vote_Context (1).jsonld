    "comment": "In my view, the 2025 Vision & Roadmap for Cardano is a well-rounded strategy that balances immediate improvements & long-term development goals.\nKey areas like scalability improvements, the modular design, and  functionalities informed my yes vote rationale balance, detailed below: \n\nPoints in Favour\nScalability Focus:\nI appreciate that the roadmap has an emphasis on scaling solutions for both Layer 1 and Layer 2. In my view, this approach is good for handling increased demand and supporting real-world applications.\nModularity, Flexibility:\nThe modular design is a positive for me because it supports future integrations (like ZK proofs for Bitcoin DeFi, enhanced privacy features) and a range of use cases -  important for maintaining a competitive edge.\nCommunity and Governance Alignment:\nThe roadmap was developed through consultations with stakeholders and includes mechanisms for ongoing feedback from DReps. This transparency and community involvement ensure a collective voice gets heard and that development stays aligned with the Constitution. \n\nStrategic Budget Alignment:\nIn my view,  supporting this document helps ensure resources be directed towards initiatives with high impact, so supports efficient and effective development.\n\nConsiderations for Improvement\nClarity in Timelines and Deliverables:\nSome initiatives could benefit from clearer, more tangible milestones. Breaking down the phases could improve transparency and set clearer expectations.\n\nAmbition v Focus:\nThe roadmap proposes a wide range of scalability initiatives, & I do have some concerns about spreading resources thinly or, intentions versus reality. Focusing on a couple of key priorities now might enable more immediate and less vague or perceived benefits, while planning for additional functionalities later.\n\nCost and Delivery Estimates:\n Including more detailed approximations regarding timelines and costs would provide a better picture of the required resource commitment. I understand these details may evolve, but a rough estimate would certainly add to the document's clarity and community confidence.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I believe that despite some areas where additional specificity would be beneficial, the roadmap is a robust and inclusive plan for advancing Cardano’s ecosystem. Its focus on scalability, modular design, and community-driven governance aligns well with the vision for Cardano’s long-term success. For these reasons, I support a yes vote.\n"
