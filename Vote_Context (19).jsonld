    "comment": "I’m voting YES to fund the maintenance and enhancement of Cardano.nix as important for reproducible infrastructure deployment and reliable node operations, meaning its a foundational component of Cardano’s technical ecosystem. Ongoing maintenance ensures stability, compatibility, and resilience for developers and enterprises building on the network.\n\nWhile this request is relatively small and future maintenance of this type may be better suited to Catalyst or bundled into larger, long-term funding mechanisms, I believe it’s important to support this proposal now. Doing so sustains essential infrastructure while giving us time to evolve treasury processes that keep the community actively involved in shaping and maintaining foundational tools.\n\nThis decision reflects my DRep principles of supporting sustainable infrastructure, ensuring long-term ecosystem health, and enabling proven contributors to continue delivering value to Cardano."
