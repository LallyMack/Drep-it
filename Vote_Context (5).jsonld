    "comment": " YES Vote\n\nIn my opinion, this proposal funds critical core infrastructure work that supports Cardano’s continued growth, security, and decentralization. Key upgrades include Ouroboros Leios, Hydra, Mithril, and Acropolis, each essential for improving scalability, node architecture, and smart contract tooling.\n\nWhile the cost is substantial, the proposal aligns with the approved 2025 budget and is subject to milestone-based funding, third-party audits, and oversight mechanisms managed by Intersect. These controls help ensure accountability and transparency.\n\nGiven IO’s track record in delivering foundational Cardano components, and the urgent need to advance L1/L2 capabilities, I believe this represents a strategic and necessary investment in the network’s future.\n\n"
