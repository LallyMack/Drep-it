    "comment": "I’m voting YES to support the Paid Open Source Model proposal. Open source is fundamental to Cardano’s identity and long-term success, our ecosystem’s sustainability, security, and ability to innovate all depend on strong, well-supported maintainers and infrastructure and concerned that dependence on voluntary efforts is not enough to meet future needs.\n\nThis proposal introduces a structured and transparent approach to funding, retaining skilled contributors, maintaining critical repositories, and improving security through dedicated programs. With the administrative processes and oversight mechanisms in place to manage these funds responsibly, I believe this initiative strengthens Cardano’s foundations and aligns with my commitment to sustainable growth, responsible stewardship, and empowers open, community driven innovation."
