    "comment": "I’m voting YES to fund zkFold’s ZK Rollup development. This initiative delivers a general-purpose, zero-knowledge rollup solution that will significantly enhance Cardano’s scalability, reduce transaction costs, and enable broader ecosystem adoption while maintaining security.\n\nThis vote reflects my intention to execute the already-approved budget without unnecessary delays and uphold the community consensus reached through the Intersect-administered budget process. I believe it’s important to disperse funding now to enable critical infrastructure development rather than risk underfunding ecosystem progress when treasury reserves allow for sustainable investment.\n\nWhile I will not typically support future individual treasury withdrawal requests under 1.5M ADA, preferring these to be managed via Catalyst or bundled entities, I will for this round  due to oversight mechanisms (audited smart contracts, multi-party governance, milestones disbursement, and transparency) that should provide confidence that funds will be responsibly managed.\n\nThis aligns with my DRep principles of supporting sustainable, long-term innovation, enabling scalable infrastructure, and respecting collective decisions that strengthen Cardano’s governance and ecosystem health.\n\n"
