    "comment": "I’m voting NO on this proposal. While improving liquidity and exchange access for Cardano-native tokens is a valid goal, this proposal lacks the level of detail and structure needed to responsibly and confidently allocate such a significant amount of treasury funds.\n\nThere is not a clear enough process for how decisions on token or exchange selection would be made, how listing costs would be determined, on how fairness and accountability would be ensured. This opens the door to potential manipulation and inequitable outcomes that do not necessarily align with Cardano’s culture of decentralization and community-driven growth.\n\nAs it stands, this feels more like an early-stage idea than a fully developed, executable plan. Without stronger justification, transparency, and safeguards, I cannot support this high funding request.\n\nI would like to see this proposal return with a clearer plan to ensure demonstrable inclusion, fairness and strategy, rationale for returns to cardano eco system that are in line with the amount asked \n\n"
